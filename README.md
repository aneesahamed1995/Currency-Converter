Here are some key highlights of the project:

MVVM-Clean Architecture:

1.Implemented a modular and scalable architecture for enhanced code organization.
2.Separated concerns into layers (presentation, domain, and data) for clarity and maintainability.
3.Utilized ViewModel for the Presenter layer, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

Coroutines for Background Operations:

1.Employed Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous and non-blocking programming, enhancing the efficiency of background operations.

Retrofit for HTTP Network Calls:

1.Integrated Retrofit for seamless and efficient HTTP network calls, ensuring a robust communication layer between the app and the server.

Koin for Dependency Injection:

1.Utilized Koin for dependency injection to facilitate the management of object creation and promote code maintainability. While time constraints influenced this choice, it demonstrates my understanding of dependency injection concepts.

Compose and XML for UI Design:

1.Leveraged Jetpack Compose for modern UI development and XML for traditional layouts, providing flexibility and adaptability to different design paradigms.

SSL Public Key Pinning:

1.Implemented SSL Public Key Pinning for enhanced security, with a particular focus on backward compatibility for devices below API 24, using both network configuration and a third-party library.

Version Catalog for Dependency Management:

Employed Version Catalog for streamlined and consistent dependency management, ensuring compatibility and ease of updates across the codebase.

Kotlin DSL for Gradle:

Utilized Kotlin DSL for Gradle to enhance build script readability and maintainability, aligning with modern practices for Android development.
